These scripts are part of the project: PROMIS and Work ability: a Lifelines cohort study

They load, wrangle, analyze, and output the data objects, figures and tables associated with the research project.

The scripts are numbered according to the order in which they should be run. It is particularly important to run the 0. file first as this creates the file directories that form the basis of reading and saving datafiles.
